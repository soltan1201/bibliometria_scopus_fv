dados SKYPE image para estimação do potencial energetico



Prepare the initial dataset-The historic Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) dataset from 1990-2013 with
.tm2 file extension are used to generate the weather data for the proposed algorithm. The System Advisor Model (SAM)
is used to generate the energy output of the PV system [24]. The SAM is developed by the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) to estimate the energy output of renewable energy systems including PV generators by the physical
model of the system  (a new data driven long-term solar yield analysis model of photovoltaic power plants)


. Results show that SSRD, a reanalysis data from ERA5, is a better alternative to in situ solar irradiance when forecasting solar PV output for the hot dry and cool dry seasons. Meanwhile, SWR, a satellite-based solar irradiance data from Himawari 08,
